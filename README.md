# Cider-Scribe
a small script(s?) that can use Cider's Websockets API to retrieve song info and can put them in .txt files, and download album art.

## Status
Currently unspaghetti-fying and making a functional optional UI that can enable/disable features: .txt output, album art download, and UI itself. Launch Arguments will also be added in and listed if you would like to not use the UI.

### Current Features
Scribe can currently get info from Cider using either the Websockets API.

Once Scribe retrieves music info it can distribute it via .txt files for each variable, or use it for built in miniplayer (WIP - may not be kept)

Scribe can also download album art with the resolution of choice with a max of 800x800. It is recommended to keep a 1:1 ratio. (I also have no idea if it even can pass 800x800 or do anything other than 1:1 :P )

Thats it for now! I'll keep tweaking this as i need to, feel free to open a PR if youd like to contribute, recommend a feature or report a bug!
